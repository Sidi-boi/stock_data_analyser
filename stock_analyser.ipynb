       "\n",

       "\n",
       "3. **Volatility**\n",
       "   - There were significant fluctuations between the highest and lowest stock prices each week, notably in early 2023, indicating high volatility.\n",
       "   - The stock experienced declines followed by rebounds, particularly throughout 2023 before stabilizing at a higher price point by 2024.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Dividend Payments**\n",
       "   - **Dividends:** GOOG made several small dividend payments averaging **$0.20**, which can contribute to overall returns alongside capital gains.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Volume Insight\n",
       "- The trading volume varied significantly, with some weeks showing high trading activity (over **200 million** shares) during noteworthy price moves, while other weeks had significantly lower volume indicating less activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Calculation of Total Returns\n",
       "To calculate the total return over the period, we will use the following formula:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Total Return (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Final Price} - \\text{Initial Price}}{\\text{Initial Price}} \\right) \\times 100\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Initial Price (Jan 1, 2022):** **$89.31** \n",
       "- **Final Price (Feb 21, 2025):** **$181.58**\n",
       "\n",
       "### Calculation:\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Total Return (\\%)} = \\left( \\frac{181.58 - 89.31}{89.31} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{92.27}{89.31} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 103.3\\%\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "- **Total Expected Return:** Approximately **103.3%** over the reviewed period.\n",
       "- The stock has more than doubled in value, suggesting strong performance for investors during this timeframe, amidst notable price fluctuations and volatility.\n",
       "- New investors looking at GOOG should consider market conditions, historical performance, and potential risks associated with stock price volatility."
